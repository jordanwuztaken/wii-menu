# Wii Menu Clone

This repository is an HTML/CSS/JS clone of a Wii Menu-style Scratch project.

Notes:
- You confirmed you have permission to copy the original project's assets. I have added placeholder SVG assets in the `assets/` folder. Replace them with the original image/audio files and keep their filenames (or update `project.json`).
- Controls supported: Mouse, keyboard (Arrow keys, Enter, Esc), and touch.
- To publish the site with GitHub Pages:
  1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
  2. Settings → Pages.
  3. Select branch `main` and `/ (root)` folder, Save.
  4. The site will be available at `https://jordanwuztaken.github.io/wii-menu/` within a minute.

License & Credits:
- Assets: replace with the original Scratch project assets (you confirmed permission).
- Code: MIT-style permissive use.
